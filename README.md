###### This Github Repository contains the code for the Mini Data Analysis Milestone 1 Assignment in STAT 545A. 

The dataset used in this analysis was Vancouver_trees, which contained both categorical and numerical information on various tree species planted throughout Vancouver. This dataset contains information on more than 146,000 trees and has been maintained since 1989. The information on the trees in this dataset includes taxonomy, location, size and when the trees were planted. 

The code in this repository is organized into 2 main sections. 
* The first section explores four different datasets, to gain an understanding of the different data available to use for this project, with an explanation of why I chose to work with the Vancouver_trees dataset.
* The second section explores the Vancouver_trees dataset and four questions are examined using functions in ggplot2 and dplyr in tidyverse to produce graphs that can be used to interpret the data.
* There are also five research questions throughout the code that ask questions to discover relationships between the variables in the Vancouver_trees dataset.
