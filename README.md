## Mini Data Analysis Milestone 1 
#### Laura Simonson, Student ID: 60858685
##### This Github Repository contains the code for the Mini Data Analysis Milestone 1 & 2 Assignment in STAT 545A. 

##### Milestone 1
The dataset used in this analysis was Vancouver_trees, which contained both categorical and numerical information on various tree species planted throughout Vancouver. This dataset contains information on more than 146,000 trees and has been maintained since 1989. The information on the trees in this dataset includes taxonomy, location, size and when the trees were planted. 

The code in Milestone 1 is organized into 2 main sections. 
* The first section explores four different datasets, to gain an understanding of the different data available to use for this project, with an explanation of why I chose to work with the Vancouver_trees dataset.
* The second section explores the Vancouver_trees dataset and four questions are examined using functions in ggplot2 and dplyr in tidyverse to produce graphs that can be used to interpret the data.
* There are also five research questions throughout the code that ask questions to discover relationships between the variables in the Vancouver_trees dataset. 


##### Milestone 2
Milestone 2 is a continuation of the MDA Milestone 1 assignment and further analyzes the same Vancouver_trees dataset, in terms of 4 research questions that were created in Milestone 2. 
The four research questions analyzed in mini data analysis were:
1. How does tree species diversity vary across different neighbourhoods of Vancouver?
2. Is there a relationship between the age of the trees and how wide their diameter is?
3. Is there a correlation between the species of tree and how big it is, in terms of height and diameter?
4. Since this data started to be collected, have trends of planting trees susceptible to invasive species (American Elm, Green Ash, and White Ash) declined?

The code in Milestone 2 is organized into 4 main sections. 
* The first section investigates the four research questions by answering one summarizing and one graphing question provided for each of the four questions.
* The second section explores tidy data. The first part identifies the vancouver_trees dataset as tidy data, and the second part makes the dataset untidy, then re-tidies the dataset back to its original tidy state.
* The third section fits a model to further answer one of the research questions and produces a tibble for the model.
* The final section, exploring reading and writing data, creates paths for saving .csv and .rds files in this repository.
